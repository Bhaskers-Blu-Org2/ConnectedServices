# Getting Started Series: Hello World of Connected Services #
**Note**: *this section is just a beginning. as we develop more content, this will continue to evolve*

This section is your getting started content, to get your initial Connected Service up and running. While we've grouped content into sections, we expect you'll read through this group sequentially to create your baseline Connected Service. You might think these topics as reading a book, with a continuous story with chapters as just pauses in the continuing story. 
Once you're finished with this section, you'll move onto the [Advanced Series](./AdvancedSeries.md), which will be more like a reference book, where you skip around to different chapters based on what you're focused on at the time.
