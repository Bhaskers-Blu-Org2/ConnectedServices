# Getting Started Series: Hello World of Connected Services #
This section is your getting started content, to get your initial Connected Service up and running. While we've grouped content into sections, we expect you'll read through this group sequentially to create your baseline Connected Service. Think of reading a book, as a story, with chapters. 
Once you're finished with this section, you'll move onto the Advanced Series, which will be more like a reference book.
